			<p>
				I did a makeovermonday Challenge with Data.World to see the comparison of each player on the Arsenal FC 2018-2019 roster in each category of soccer provided by data.world. 
				I also created sql queries to take a more depth analysis of the data to see if there are any deficiencies or biases that may be present. 
				One inference that i could make is minutes played are skewed towards goalkeepers since this position is rarely substituted in a game. 
				Another inference is passes and touches are skewed favorably for players who are midfielders or forwards.
